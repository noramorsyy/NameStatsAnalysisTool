# Name Statistics Analysis Project

## Overview

I collaborated with a team of four to create a Python project aimed at analyzing the statistics of names across different provinces in Canada. The project includes a Python script for modifying and converting CSV files, ensuring a standardized format for seamless integration with the main analysis program.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Modification Script
The `fileConvert.py` script is designed to modify and convert CSV files to ensure a consistent format. This script is crucial for preparing the data for analysis in the main program.

### 2. Name Statistics Analysis Program
The main analysis program is responsible for processing and analyzing name statistics across different provinces in Canada. The modified CSV files, generated by the fileConvert.py script, serve as input for this program.

## Imported Libraries to Install

Use the following commands to install the required libraries:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -U ethnicolr
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

# Running the Main Program

To run the main.py file, follow these steps:

### 1. Make the script executable:
```
chmod 777 main.py
```
### 2. Run the script with the required input files:
```
./main.py -a ALBERTA_1980_2021_MALE.csv -b ALBERTA_1980_2021_FEMALE.csv -c NOVASCOTIA_1920_2022_MALE.csv -d NOVASCOTIA_1920_2022_FEMALE.csv
```
